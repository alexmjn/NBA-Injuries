# NBA Injuries
This repository loads and analyzes daily NBA injury reports to discover and graph patterns in the data over time, between players, and between teams. It showcases performing and communicating a thorough exploratory data analysis.

Heavily annotated data analysis is contained in the file `NBA_Injuries.ipynb`, and the data itself is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ghopkins/nba-injuries-2010-2018) and takes place between 2010 and 2018.
